## PHP Installation

1. Download **XAMPP**

   XAMPP application has bundled PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, Apache HTTPD, and others

2. **PATH** Setting

3. **PHP** file
   - PHP program code files end with the .php extension
   - At the beginning of the PHP program code, it is mandatory to add **`<?php`**. And at the end of the php program code you need to add **`?>`** (but not required)
   - There are no rules for PHP file names, so we can create PHP files like we would any other file. However, in order to make it easier to run PHP files, it is recommended not to use spaces.
   - To display text in PHP, we can use the **`echo`** command
